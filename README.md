    <h1>Investment Strategies: <i>For any level of investers!</i></h1>

    #picture_here

    <p>There are many different strategies when it comes to investing and picking the right one that fits your lifestyle
        can be tricky. The question you need to ask yourself is;
        "How often will I cash out my profits?" If your answer is "never" then buying high quality companies and holding
        the stock forever will suit you well. For those who want to take profits
        weekly or monthly, maybe swing trading is your style. Another question to ask yourself is "How much time am I
        willing to look at stocks and their trends?". Generally, the less time you have to check your
        stocks, the more of a long term invester you are. Below is a list of trading strategies grouped together by how
        much time you have to spend researching, buying, and selling stocks.</p>

        <p>Choosing the right investment strategy depends on your lifestyle and how much time you are willing to invest
            in the stock market. Whether that means time holding stocks or time spent
            on doing your due dilligence. As you can see, if your schedule is wide open, then you have time do any
            strategy that you choose. Then, you just have to decide how much time you want to
            spend looking at your computer or app on your phone. Swing trading is very popular because you can be away
            for a few hours without being able to track your stock and it wouldn't affect
            your strategy. While I'm putting in lots of hours at work in a week, I like to swing trade stocks and
            options. If I'm off for a day or two through the week, then I like to day trade.
            For beginners, it's best to start with a long term portfolio. It's best to buy early. The longer you hold a
            quality stock, the more profit you typically earn.
            Compound interest is the key to long term wealth. The best investers use their short term gains to fund
            their long term portfolio. Think about it. Free money(profit from short term portfolio)
            buying assets(dividend stocks) that pay you every quarter and then using the dividend payout to buy more
            dividend stocks. Thats
            the ultimate goal. Not everyone can do that but hopefully your short term investing strategy can get you on
            that path.

        <h2>Day Trading</h2>

        <p>Day Trading doesn't always take up a lot of time. I can get on my phone while in the bathroom at work and
            scalp some options for a quick profit. Scalping means I'm buying
            and selling the stock within minutes. On the other hand, I could lose that money within minutes if the trade
            didn't go my way. It's best to do your research and know what trades you're looking for before
            the market opens. This is why day trading takes the most time to get right. Whatever strategy you are using,
            you will have to do your own
            research and figure out what stock you want to play, the entry price you are going to buy and what your exit
            strategy will be(when to sell).
            Before getting in a trade, you should know your entry and exit plan.
